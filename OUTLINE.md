Quote from http://www.final-call.us/Discrepencies%20in%20NT%20scriptures.pdf
I wanted to make a point about the hidden code or, rather agenda of those who have and are doing this to the scriptures: I am seeing just as Kat, there is an unusual amount of language now throughout scriptures that seems to place God in a very dull light. It promotes the Kingdom of Satan and the Luciferian Agenda that wants to erase God out of existence! There is I would call for lack of a better phrase “fairytale language” now running through the scriptures, with castle, princes 352 times, king's courts and palaces, dragons and damsels, seed royal and butlers. Satan wants to discredit scripture and make it confused and unintelligible!
