## Noticed Biblical changes:

* Not sure if change or not
See video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kWPr5fqwRE&t=53s
Isaiah 53:12 and Hebrews 9:28 - Jesus now only died for many not for all? Is that really a change?

* Psalm 46:10 nations changed to heathen

* suburbs” and “mortgage”
* to “take up thy couch” or Genesis 49:9 to say “he couched as a lion”? The word was CROUCHED! No one couches, they crouch!
Genesis 49:14 “Issachar is a strong ass COUCHING down between two burdens:”. Also “ass” , was donkey !
* john 5:39 was changed to a command from a rebuking statement

* romans 3:23 - see post here https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=558372674369424&set=a.136622499877779.1073741831.100005900890427&type=3&permPage=1 (see here: http://i.imgur.com/UQ1D7dr.png)

* list of emoticons in the Bible (however, the year 2011 is impossible, as the emoticons only appeared later on, history changed recursively): http://jerrysnook.net/KJV%20Emoticons,%20Web%20Version.pdf

## Take a look at the false logic that is presented by the false teachers and note their arguments to refute them
* Sermon 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO1VsR39KcU / Notes on the sermon: http://www.newcovenantbaptist.org/the-mandela-effect-deception/
* Chuck misslers wisdom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAOmVqzbUqQ / Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpzcPuFbc_8&t=1s
* continue to refute false teachings taught here: https://youtu.be/qYx1-tF_R_M?t=22m24s (video named "End Times & Demons 7: Rothschilds, Mandela Effect, Flat Earth, 501c3, Post-Trib & Conspiracies")
* the original KJV 1611 says it how it is now, thus the Mandela-Effect is a lie, it never changed - see example here: https://www.facebook.com/tom.anastasios.5/posts/10159698744310537
