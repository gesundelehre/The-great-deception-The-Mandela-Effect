## Noticed Biblical changes:

* Not sure if change or not
See video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kWPr5fqwRE&t=53s
Isaiah 53:12 and Hebrews 9:28 - Jesus now only died for many not for all? Is that really a change?

* Psalm 46:10 nations changed to heathen

* suburbs” and “mortgage”
* to “take up thy couch” or Genesis 49:9 to say “he couched as a lion”? The word was CROUCHED! No one couches, they crouch!
Genesis 49:14 “Issachar is a strong ass COUCHING down between two burdens:”. Also “ass” , was donkey !
