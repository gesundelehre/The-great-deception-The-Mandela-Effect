He even says remembering “stuff” in the Bible and he also remembers “judge not that ye be not judged” and he says he remembers when he first read the Bible the first time cover to cover in 1999, that he even back then already read “wolf and lamb” in the Bible.
He even puts the blame on people who remember things correctly and basically alludes to that they have a character problem.
He wants people who remember things correctly to admit that they made a mistake and misquoted or misheard something or that you remembered something wrong.
This is clearly the same approach as Satan in the Garden of Eden, saying “did God really say”? Basically the snake said “do you remember correctly what God said”?
