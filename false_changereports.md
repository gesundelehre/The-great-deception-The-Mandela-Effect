EYA: Jeremiah 5:30-31 / "my people love to have it so" is not a change. But it shows that the evil people back then loved the false prophets. This is perfectly a correct historical fact -- see here: https://youtu.be/ti_BQAZg8qg?t=8m35s -- jesus also said "woe unto you if all people will speak well of you, for so did their fathers unto the false prophets"

EYA: "..you bear it well..."
